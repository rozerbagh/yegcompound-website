Bio-identical hormone replacement therapy uses hormones that are identical to those found in the human body instead of synthetic hormones or chemicals that mimic hormones.

There are many advantages to transdermal delivery of hormones, the main being the bypass of liver metabolism. We use cream bases that are gentle, moisturizing, aesthetically pleasing, good for vaginal use and ideal for drug delivery through the skin. In addition, we use metered-dose dispensers that provide precise dosing.",
